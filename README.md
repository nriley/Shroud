Shroud
======

A sensory deprivation tank for your Mac.

Building Shroud
---------------

1. Clone this repository.
2. ```cd /path/to/Shroud```
3. ```git submodule update --init --force```
4. Open the project file in Xcode and build. 

Any relatively modern Xcode should work (currently I'm building with Xcode 10 on macOS 10.14).

Documentation is in Apple Help format, built with a custom version of [Helpify](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/Helpify_the_Omni_Help_Emitter) as part of the build process.

Need ideas?
-----------

Open `Shroud to do.ooutline` in OmniOutliner — it contains many ideas I haven’t had time to implement.  If you don't have OmniOutliner, use [this HTML version](https://rawgit.com/nriley/Shroud/master/Shroud%20to%20do.html/index.html) instead.
