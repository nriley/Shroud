Shroud
======

A sensory deprivation tank for your Mac.

Building Shroud
---------------

1. Clone this repository.
2. ```cd /path/to/Shroud```
3. ```git submodule update --init --force```
4. Open the project file in Xcode and build. 

Any relatively modern Xcode should work (currently I'm building with Xcode 7.2.1 on OS X 10.10 and 10.11).

Documentation is in Apple Help format, built with a custom version of [Helpify](https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/Helpify_the_Omni_Help_Emitter) as part of the build process.

Need ideas?
-----------

Open `Shroud to do.oo3` in OmniOutliner — it contains many ideas I haven’t had time to implement.  If you don't have OmniOutliner, use [this HTML version](https://rawgit.com/nriley/Shroud/master/Shroud%20to%20do.html/index.html) instead.
